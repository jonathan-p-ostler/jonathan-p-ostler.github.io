        Welcome to my watch and clock repair portfolio. Below are some time pieces I have worked on. Some were from local customers and some my own.

    <p class="top-text">
        Ladies wristwatch. 1956 21st birthday gift. After not being worn for decades I was asked by the original owner to attempt repairs and service the movement. 
        Main issues were various breakages on the bracelet and deep scratches on crystal. The movement was found to be in very good condition and needed a basic service.

        <br><br>
        Work done: <br>
        Scratches removed.  <br>
        Cleaned dial, case and bracelet. <br>
        Repaired bracelet:  Made some new link springs, 1 new steel link & 2 brass rivets, and 1 new link cover. <br>
        Serviced movement:  Dis-assembled to check and cleaned wheel pivots and holes, lubricated and tested <br>

        Fiat car clock from the 1920s. Owned by myself. Arrived very dirty and could imagine years of Italian road journeys adding to it's condition.
        Main issues were very unstable dial paint (a common issue on these) and needing a general clean and parts check. <br>
         
        I like to do just enough to get a watch or clock going again without over restoring the general appearance as the sense of age and it's history can be lost.
        <br><br>
        Work done: <br>
            Stabilised dial paint and sympathetic restoration. <br>
            Dismantled, cleaned and checked movement. Lubrication

            Ladies pendant watch circa 1950s-60s. A local customer asked me to attempt repair on their Mothers watch. Of great sentimental value to them, I find making someone happy as a result of getting it going again very gratifying. 
            I was told the main issue was a broken winding stem. On inspection I also found both balance wheel pivots broken, the dial loose and all needed a good clean.  
        
        <br><br>
        Work done: <br>
            Transferred original hairspring onto a spare balance wheel. <br>
            Disassembled movement and cleaned parts. <br>
            Fitted new winding stem with the original crown. <br>
            Improved fit of dial and centre seconds spinner. <br>
            lubricated movement <br>
            testing
